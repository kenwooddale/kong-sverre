    <h3>Ancestry<br>
    </h3>
    Both my maternal and paternal sides of the family immigrated to
    Kendall County, Illinois near Chicago from Norway in the mid 1800s,
    some by way of Minnesota. <br>
    <br>
    I was told my parents had considered the name Kendall for me.<br>
    <br>
    They were farmers.&nbsp; Probably, like most immigrates, started
    with very little.&nbsp; Records indicate many were prosperous
    farmers and leaders in the community.<br>
    <br>
    One nice June weekend in 1990 Terri and I decided to drive to
    northern Illinois and see if we could find information about
    Norwegian immigrants.<br>
    <br>
    Members of both sides of my family have done extensive genealogy
    research – convenient for me. <br>
    <br>
    <h3>The Farm<br>
    </h3>
    I was born and raised on an Iowa farm, until attending a technical
    school in Chicago after high school.&nbsp; I liked the farm
    life.&nbsp; My Dad had a small to average sized farm.&nbsp; I was
    the oldest of three boys, and helped with a lot of farm work.&nbsp;
    Probably drove a tractor before age six.&nbsp; Farm work was hard,
    but we always seemed to have nice clothes and cars.<br>
    <br>
    <h3>Chicago<br>
    </h3>
    Chicago was a real experience, and a great change from the farm and
    small town.&nbsp; I had a room with two other guys in the house of a
    real nice Irish family.&nbsp; I went to school and worked part
    time.&nbsp; Everybody worked.&nbsp; The school had a housing and
    employment office.&nbsp; If you didn’t like your part time job, you
    quit and got another. &nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    Chicago was an electronics center.&nbsp; Many of us students worked
    part time at electronics companies.&nbsp; One of the nation’s
    largest electronics retail stores was Allied Radio in Chicago.&nbsp;
    I enjoyed spending a couple hours there on Saturday
    afternoons.&nbsp; You could get almost anywhere in Chicago on public
    transportation.&nbsp; There were several restaurants within easy
    walking distance from the house.<br>
    <br>
    Some weekends my roommate and I rode the bus and “L” (elevated rail
    &amp; subway) to downtown Chicago.&nbsp; I just loved downtown
    Chicago.&nbsp; Ron and I might stop at a $1.99 stake house, and then
    a movie in one of the majestic old downtown theaters.<br>
    <br>
    In those days Chicago was known as “The city that works” – clean and
    little crime.&nbsp; Mayor Richard J Daily ruled with an iron hand.<br>
    <br>
    <h3>KCRG<br>
    </h3>
    After completing a communications course at DeVry, I worked at a TV
    station in Cedar Rapids.&nbsp; That was fun.&nbsp; It was all
    weekend and evening work.&nbsp; I was a cameraman and weekend studio
    supervisor.&nbsp; Fun being around the talent during working and
    after hours.&nbsp; After two years, I wanted more of a
    challenge.&nbsp; I returned to DeVry for a degree program. &nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    <h3>Return to School<br>
    </h3>
    I had my car there, and shared an apartment with three other
    guys.&nbsp; I had money saved up, so didn’t need to work part
    time.&nbsp; Didn’t use the car much - maybe to the beach in the
    summertime.<br>
    <br>
    <h3>McDonnell Aircraft<br>
    </h3>
    McDonnell Aircraft was hiring lots of people in the early
    sixties.&nbsp; I worked in the same general building complex for 35
    years under different company names. I liked the work, and for the
    most part, the people.&nbsp; Both Boeing and ISSC (IBM) offered an
    early retirement.&nbsp; I needed something to do in retirement.<br>
    <br>
    <h3>Volunteering<br>
    </h3>
    One of my longtime coworkers at Boeing (bless his heart) introduced
    me to Wings of Hope.&nbsp; I learned to fly at Lambert Field in the
    early seventies, and always had an interest in aviation.&nbsp; So,
    volunteering at an aviation charity was a good fit.&nbsp; I
    volunteered for over twenty years at Wings, and really enjoyed the
    work and the people.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Flying<br>
    </h3>
    Terri and I bought an airplane in July 1999.&nbsp; We had it about
    eighteen years, and took it (VFR) almost to the East coast and
    almost to the West coast. &nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    I went into Albuquerque International, Nashville International, and
    Chicago Midway among others. We made over thirty trips to Iowa.
    &nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    I liked the one and two overnight trips we took in the
    Cherokee.&nbsp; I hardly ever made hotel/motel reservations – tried
    to avoid get-there-itis.&nbsp; Travel in a GA aircraft was much more
    pleasant than flying commercial.&nbsp; FBOs were friendly and
    usually&nbsp; helped with overnight accommodations.&nbsp; They
    sometimes made reservations and arranged transportation – maybe a
    van or crew car (free).&nbsp; There was usually a pilot’s lounge
    with vending machines, etc.&nbsp; Of course, we could only travel
    during nice weather.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I waited about six weeks
    before we launched on our first of three trips to Durango, Colorado
    to visit relatives.&nbsp; We made over thirty trips to Iowa to visit
    my parents.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Radio<br>
    </h3>
    I love radio.&nbsp; I built a crystal radio with a cat’s-whisker
    detector and a 150’ antenna on the farm.&nbsp; I think I could
    receive two or three stations.&nbsp; My brother and I built a
    Knight-kit Wireless Broadcaster from Allied Radio.&nbsp; We had 2
    turntables, and could broadcast about a mile.&nbsp; I also built one
    of the first Citizen’s Band Radios (17W7183) in the area.&nbsp; When
    traveling on the road, I would much prefer to listen to an AM radio
    station instead of listening to a recording. &nbsp;<br>
